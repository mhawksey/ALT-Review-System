        <input name="criteria[]" type="checkbox" id="criteria_1" class="filled-in setting" value="1. Relates to theme" />
        <label for="criteria_1">Does explain how the session relates to the chosen conference theme.</label>
        <input name="criteria[]" type="checkbox" id="criteria_2" class="filled-in setting" value="2. Clearly written" />
        <label for="criteria_2">Is clearly written (i.e. acronyms are explained, and language appropriate for an international audience and from participants from different sectors).</label>
        <input name="criteria[]" type="checkbox" id="criteria_3" class="filled-in setting" value="3. Session outcome" />
        <label for="criteria_3">States what participants will gain from the session and why they should attend.</label>
        <input name="criteria[]" type="checkbox" id="criteria_4" class="filled-in setting" value="4. Critical refection" />
        <label for="criteria_4">Includes details of what the session is based on, such as a particular project or initiative or practice? Does it critically reflect on this and evaluate it (i.e. state how many learners/staff are involved, what feedback was collected and how transferable your experience/findings/tools are).</label>
        <input name="criteria[]" type="checkbox" id="criteria_5" class="filled-in setting" value="5. Commercial acknowledgement" />
        <label for="criteria_5">If it is a commercial proposal, we ask that it meets all the above criteria and clearly states what products are being demonstrated or discussed and acknowledges the role of the company in the session.</label>

                    will be directly sent to the authors, so be as clear and detailed as you can be about what changes they should make.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item"><strong>Accept as different type</strong> - Accept the proposal, but as a different type: use this option if you feel the proposal was submitted in the wrong format, i.e. it would be better as a short presentation or poster. In your
                    feedback specify how the proposal needs to be revised in order to be accepted as a different type of session.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item"><strong>Recommend re-submission</strong> - The proposal cannot be accepted, but you feel that it meets the criteria to a sufficient degree that it could be accepted if it was revised. Your feedback will be directly sent to the authors,
                    so be as clear and detailed as you can be about what changes they should make.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item"><strong>Reject</strong> - Reject the proposal if it is out of scope, of poor quality or otherwise fails to meet the criteria and you feel it cannot be improved sufficiently by making revisions.</li>

                <h3>How to write feedback for authors</h3></div>
              <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>The feedback you provide is sent to authors, so keep this in mind when writing your comments.</p>
                <p>Be concise, sometimes a sentence or two is enough and we ask that feedback is as clear and specific as possible, referring directly to sentences or sections of the proposal that should be revised.</p>
                <p>Here are tips from other reviewers:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                  <li>Avoid praising or criticising the author, make sure all comments refer to the proposal . Consider giving 3 points of positive feedback, followed by the suggestions for change, which (as suggested below) should be focussed on what the
                    author needs to do, rather than general comments.</li>
                  <li>Try to write feedback that you’d be happy to receive and that the authors can clearly action. Be positive in your language and constructive in your suggestions, rather than tell people what the problem is tell them what you think the
                    solution should be.</li>
                  <li>For example: If you think a workshop proposal sounds boring, try saying “This session needs more interaction, please include details of the activities your participants will be doing during the session”.</li>
                  <li>Remember that just because someone has done something in a different way than you would have done it, does not make them wrong. Be respectful and be explicit about the nature of the advice you are giving: for example, are you are offering
                    suggestions for consideration (“the proposal could be enhanced by the inclusion of…”), or insisting on a problem being fixed (“this section is unclear and should be rewritten”)?</li>
                  <li>Keep in mind that our authors come from different sectors and backgrounds and English may not be their first language.</li>
