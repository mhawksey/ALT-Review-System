                    will be directly sent to the authors, so be as clear and detailed as you can be about what changes they should make.</li>

                    feedback specify how the proposal needs to be revised in order to be accepted as a different type of session.</li>

                  <h3>How to write feedback for authors</h3></div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                  <p>The feedback you provide is sent to authors, so keep this in mind when writing your comments.</p>
                  <p>Be concise, sometimes a sentence or two is enough and we ask that feedback is as clear and specific as possible, referring directly to sentences or sections of the proposal that should be revised.</p>
                  <p>Here are tips from other reviewers:</p>
                  <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>Avoid praising or criticising the author(s), make sure all comments refer to the proposal. Rather than general comments, consider giving a few specific  points of positive feedback, followed by suggestions for change, which (as suggested below) should be focussed on what the author could do to improve the proposal.</li>
                    <li>Try to write feedback that you’d be happy to receive and that the authors can clearly action. Be positive in your language and constructive in your suggestions. rather than simply stating any problems that you identify or anticipate for the session, you can suggest changes/additions to the proposal that would improve it (particularly in line with the review criteria). For example: If you think a workshop proposal sounds more like a one-way presentation, you might say “This session  would benefit from more interaction; please include details of the ways participants will be invited to engage  during the session”.</li>
                    <li>Remember that just because someone has done something in a different way than you would have done it, does not make them wrong. Please be respectful and be explicit about the nature of the advice you are giving. For example, are you offering suggestions for consideration (“the proposal could be enhanced by the inclusion of…”), or insisting on a problem being fixed (“this section is unclear and should be rewritten”)?</li>
                    <li>Keep in mind that our authors come from different sectors and backgrounds and English may not be their first language.</li>
